# MahTweets

A WPF Twitter Client for power Twitter users- possibly one of the oldest out there.

MahTweets is built in the style of a "shed project" - its something we tinker on in our spare time and things like process and UX are not a focus.

## An introduction to MahTweets

Paul Jenkins started a great Twitter client back in the day - it was a thing of wonderment.

As time passed, more people rallied to his cause, code was written and great features added. The scope of MahTweets grew to being a rich social media client. Everyone's ideas were committed to code and binaries where shipped.

Like all good things, they don't last forever. MahTweets was officially retired in October 2011, but the code remained on Codeplex for people to view and fork.

## Introduction to MahTweets.LawrenceHargrave

I picked up the last build of [MahTweets 3.5.0.1569](http://mahtweets.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets) over on codeplex.com and started hacking on it. Forked it, if you will. In stealth mode.

[List of Changes since MahTweets 3.5](wiki/initialchanges)

There are a couple reasons why I picked Lawrence Hargrave as a code name:

1. He is Australian
2. He was a pioneer of flight, and specifically the box kite
3. Twitter / birds / flight
4. He did not patent any of his ideas
5. Like the MahApps leader, Paul Jenkins, he has a cracking beard
